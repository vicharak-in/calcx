# **CalcX**

## **Overview**

**CalcX** is a computation module built on the **RAH (Real-time Application Handler)** protocol, developed by [Vicharak](https://vicharak.in). It enables seamless communication between a CPU and an FPGA, providing a wide range of mathematical operations such as:

- **Trigonometric Functions:** `sin`, `cos`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `arcsin`, `arccos`, `arctan` , `sqrt`
- **Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:** `exp`, `ln`
- **Arithmetic Operations:** `add`, `sub`, `mult`, `div`
- **Bitwise Shifting:** `left shift`, `right shift`
- **Special Operations:** `integer square root`, `float-to-fixed`, and `fixed-to-float` conversions

These operations are executed on the FPGA, with data communication managed via the RAH protocol.


## **RAH Protocol**

The **RAH (Real-time Application Handler)** protocol is engineered to support real-time data exchange between a CPU and an FPGA. It works by encapsulating data into structured frames, each associated with a unique `app_id`. These frames are sent to the FPGA and routed to the corresponding `APP_WR_FIFO`.

For outgoing data (from FPGA to CPU), the FPGA writes results to `APP_RD_FIFO`. These results are then encapsulated and sent back to the CPU for decoding.

This design provides a modular and scalable framework for implementing high-performance computational modules on FPGA.
